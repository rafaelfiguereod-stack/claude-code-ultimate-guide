# Data Privacy & Retention Guide

> **Critical**: Everything you share with Claude Code is sent to Anthropic servers. This guide explains what data leaves your machine and how to protect sensitive information.

## TL;DR - Retention Summary

| Configuration | Retention Period | Training | How to Enable |
|---------------|------------------|----------|---------------|
| **Consumer (default)** | 5 years | Yes | (default state) |
| **Consumer (opt-out)** | 30 days | No | [claude.ai/settings](https://claude.ai/settings/data-privacy-controls) |
| **Team / Enterprise / API** | 30 days | No (default) | Use Team, Enterprise plan, or API keys |
| **ZDR (Zero Data Retention)** | 0 days server-side | No | Appropriately configured API keys |

**Immediate action**: [Disable training data usage](https://claude.ai/settings/data-privacy-controls) to reduce retention from 5 years to 30 days.

## 1. Understanding the Data Flow

### What Leaves Your Machine

When you use Claude Code, the following data is sent to Anthropic:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    YOUR LOCAL MACHINE                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  • Prompts you type                                         │
│  • Files Claude reads (including .env if not excluded!)     │
│  • MCP server results (SQL queries, API responses)          │
│  • Bash command outputs                                     │
│  • Error messages and stack traces                          │
└───────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────┬───────────────┘
            │                  │              │
            ▼ HTTPS/TLS       ▼ HTTPS        ▼ HTTPS
┌───────────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐ ┌─────────────────────┐
│   ANTHROPIC API   │ │   STATSIG    │ │       SENTRY        │
├───────────────────┤ ├──────────────┤ ├─────────────────────┤
│ • Your prompts    │ │ • Latency,   │ │ • Error logs        │
│ • Model responses │ │   reliability│ │ • No code or        │
│ • Retention per   │ │ • No code or │ │   file paths        │
│   your tier       │ │   file paths │ │                     │
└───────────────────┘ └──────────────┘ └─────────────────────┘
                       (opt-out:        (opt-out:
                       DISABLE_         DISABLE_ERROR_
                       TELEMETRY=1)     REPORTING=1)
```

### What This Means in Practice

| Scenario | Data Sent to Anthropic |
|----------|------------------------|
| You ask Claude to read `src/app.ts` | Full file contents |
| You run `git status` via Claude | Command output |
| MCP executes `SELECT * FROM users` | Query results with user data |
| Claude reads `.env` file | API keys, passwords, secrets |
| Error occurs in your code | Full stack trace with paths |

## 2. Anthropic Retention Policies

### Tier 1: Consumer Default (Training Enabled)

- **Retention**: 5 years
- **Usage**: Model improvement, training data
- **Applies to**: Free, Pro, Max plans with training setting ON

### Tier 2: Consumer Opt-Out (Training Disabled)

- **Retention**: 30 days
- **Usage**: Safety monitoring, abuse prevention only
- **How to enable**:
  1. Go to https://claude.ai/settings/data-privacy-controls
  2. Disable "Allow model training on your conversations"
  3. Changes apply immediately

### Tier 3: Commercial (Team / Enterprise / API)

- **Retention**: 30 days
- **Usage**: Safety monitoring, abuse prevention only
- **Training**: Not used for training by default (no opt-out needed)
- **Applies to**: Team plans, Enterprise plans, API users, third-party platforms, Claude Gov

### Tier 4: Zero Data Retention (ZDR)

- **Retention**: 0 days server-side (local client cache may persist up to 30 days)
- **Usage**: None retained on Anthropic servers
- **Requires**: Appropriately configured API keys (see [Anthropic documentation](https://www.anthropic.com/enterprise))
- **Use cases**: HIPAA (requires separate BAA), GDPR, PCI-DSS compliance, government contracts

> **Important**: Data is encrypted in transit via TLS but is **not encrypted at rest** on Anthropic servers. Factor this into your security assessments.

## 3. Known Risks

### Risk 1: Automatic File Reading

Claude Code reads files to understand context. By default, this includes:

- `.env` and `.env.local` files (API keys, passwords)
- `credentials.json`, `secrets.yaml` (service accounts)
- SSH keys if in workspace scope
- Database connection strings

**Mitigation**: Configure `excludePatterns` (see Section 4).

### Risk 2: MCP Database Access

When you configure database MCP servers (Neon, Supabase, PlanetScale):

```
Your Query: "Show me recent orders"
            ↓
MCP Executes: SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 100
            ↓
Results Sent: 100 rows with customer names, emails, addresses
            ↓
Stored at Anthropic: According to your retention tier
```

**Mitigation**: Never connect production databases. Use dev/staging with anonymized data.

### Risk 3: Shell Command Output

Bash commands and their output are included in context:

```bash
# This output goes to Anthropic:
$ env | grep API
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-abc123...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
```

**Mitigation**: Use hooks to filter sensitive command outputs.

### Risk 4: The `/bug` Command Sends Everything (Retained 5 Years)

When you run `/bug` in Claude Code, your **full conversation history** (including all code, file contents, and potentially secrets) is sent to Anthropic for bug triage. This data is retained for **5 years**, regardless of your training opt-out setting.

This is independent of your privacy preferences: even with training disabled and 30-day retention, bug reports follow their own 5-year retention policy.

**Mitigation**: Disable the command entirely if you work with sensitive codebases:

```bash
export DISABLE_BUG_COMMAND=1
```

Or add it to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`) to make it permanent.

### Risk 5: Documented Community Incidents

| Incident | Source |
|----------|--------|
| Claude reads `.env` by default | r/ClaudeAI, GitHub issues |
| DROP TABLE attempts on poorly configured MCP | r/ClaudeAI |
| Credentials exposed via environment variables | GitHub issues |
| Prompt injection via malicious MCP servers | r/programming |

### Risk 6: Claude Desktop Browser Integration — Silent Native Messaging Host Installation

Claude Desktop installs native messaging host manifest files into browsers' `NativeMessagingHosts` directories to enable its "Claude in Chrome" feature. As of April 2026, this happens without an explicit opt-in prompt from the user.

**What gets installed:**

```
~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/
  com.anthropic.claude_browser_extension.json

/Applications/Claude.app/Contents/MacOS/
  claude_browser_native_host  (helper binary)
```

Claude Desktop writes these files to **all Chromium-based browsers found on the system** — Chrome, Brave, Edge, Arc, Vivaldi, Opera, Chromium — including browsers not installed at the time of Claude Desktop's installation. The "Don't ask" opt-out in Claude Desktop's preferences does not reliably prevent this ([GitHub #53864](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/53864), April 2026).

**What native messaging actually does (and doesn't do):**

Native messaging is a standard Chrome mechanism used by password managers, VPNs, and many other legitimate apps. The native host can only receive messages sent by a Chrome extension that explicitly targets it. It cannot initiate connections to the browser, read tabs, or access browser data unsolicited. This is architecturally different from spyware.

The real issue is the **consent failure**, not the mechanism itself. An application silently modifying another vendor's application directories violates the principle of least surprise, regardless of intent.

**What to check if you're concerned:**

```bash
# List all native messaging hosts installed for Chrome
ls ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/

# Check if Anthropic's host is present
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.anthropic.claude_browser_extension.json

# Check other browsers
ls ~/Library/Application\ Support/BraveSoftware/Brave-Browser/NativeMessagingHosts/
ls ~/Library/Application\ Support/Microsoft\ Edge/NativeMessagingHosts/
```

**To remove:**

```bash
# Remove from Chrome (repeat for each browser as needed)
rm ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.anthropic.claude_browser_extension.json

# Restart Chrome after deletion
```

Uninstalling Claude Desktop removes the helper binary but may leave stale manifest files in some browser directories. Restart the affected browsers after cleanup.

**Conflict with Claude Code:** When both Claude Desktop and Claude Code CLI are installed, the Chrome extension always binds to Claude Desktop's native host, making Claude Code's `claude-in-chrome` MCP tools unreachable ([GitHub #51949](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/51949)). This is a known bug with no workaround as of April 2026 other than uninstalling Claude Desktop.

**Mitigation:**

If you don't use the browser integration feature, you can safely delete the manifest files. Anthropic has not yet provided an official opt-out mechanism that reliably prevents installation. Monitor [GitHub #53864](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/53864) for updates.

## 4. Protective Measures

### Immediate Actions

#### 4.1 Opt-Out of Training

1. Visit https://claude.ai/settings/data-privacy-controls
2. Toggle OFF "Allow model training"
3. Retention reduces from 5 years to 30 days

#### 4.2 Configure File Exclusions

In `.claude/settings.json`, use `permissions.deny` to block access to sensitive files:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(./.env*)",
      "Edit(./.env*)",
      "Write(./.env*)",
      "Bash(cat .env*)",
      "Bash(head .env*)",
      "Read(./secrets/**)",
      "Read(./**/credentials*)",
      "Read(./**/*.pem)",
      "Read(./**/*.key)",
      "Read(./**/service-account*.json)"
    ]
  }
}
```

> **Note**: The old `excludePatterns` and `ignorePatterns` settings were deprecated in October 2025. Use `permissions.deny` instead.

> **Warning**: `permissions.deny` has [known limitations](./security-hardening.md#known-limitations-of-permissionsdeny). For defense-in-depth, combine with security hooks and external secrets management.

#### 4.3 Use Security Hooks

Create `.claude/hooks/PreToolUse.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
INPUT=$(cat)
TOOL_NAME=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool.name')

if [[ "$TOOL_NAME" == "Read" ]]; then
    FILE_PATH=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool.input.file_path')

    # Block reading sensitive files
    if [[ "$FILE_PATH" =~ \.env|credentials|secrets|\.pem|\.key ]]; then
        echo "BLOCKED: Attempted to read sensitive file: $FILE_PATH" >&2
        exit 2  # Block the operation
    fi
fi
```

#### 4.4 Opt-Out of Telemetry and Error Reporting

Claude Code connects to third-party services for operational metrics (Statsig) and error logging (Sentry). These do not include your code or file paths, but you can disable them entirely:

| Variable | What it Disables |
|----------|-----------------|
| `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` | Statsig operational metrics (latency, reliability, usage patterns) |
| `DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING=1` | Sentry error logging |
| `DISABLE_BUG_COMMAND=1` | The `/bug` command (prevents sending full conversation history) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1` | All non-essential network traffic at once |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_FEEDBACK_SURVEY=1` | Session quality surveys (note: surveys only send your numeric rating, never transcripts) |

Add these to your shell profile for permanent effect:

```bash
# In ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
export DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1
export DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING=1
export DISABLE_BUG_COMMAND=1
```

> **Note**: When using Bedrock, Vertex, or Foundry providers, all non-essential traffic (telemetry, error reporting, bug command, surveys) is disabled by default.

### MCP Best Practices

| Rule | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| **Never connect production databases** | All query results sent to Anthropic |
| **Use read-only database users** | Prevents DROP/DELETE/UPDATE accidents |
| **Anonymize development data** | Reduces PII exposure risk |
| **Create minimal test datasets** | Less data = less risk |
| **Audit MCP server sources** | Third-party MCPs may have vulnerabilities |

### For Teams

| Environment | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Development** | Opt-out + exclusions + anonymized data |
| **Staging** | Consider Enterprise API if handling real data |
| **Production** | NEVER connect Claude Code directly |

---

## 5. Comparison with Other Tools

| Feature | Claude Code + MCP | Cursor | GitHub Copilot |
|---------|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| Data scope sent | Full SQL results, files | Code snippets | Code snippets |
| Production DB access | Yes (via MCP) | Limited | Not designed for |
| Default retention | 5 years | Variable | 30 days |
| Training by default | Yes | Opt-in | Opt-in |

**Key difference**: MCP creates a unique attack surface because MCP servers are separate processes with independent network/filesystem access.

## 6. Enterprise Considerations

### When to Use Enterprise API (ZDR)

- Handling PII (names, emails, addresses)
- Regulated industries (HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS)
- Client data processing
- Government contracts
- Financial services

### Evaluation Checklist

- [ ] Data classification policy exists for your organization
- [ ] API tier matches data sensitivity requirements
- [ ] Team trained on privacy controls
- [ ] Incident response plan for potential data exposure

## 8. Intellectual Property Considerations

> **Disclaimer**: This is not legal advice. Consult a qualified attorney for your specific situation.

When using AI code generation tools, discuss these points with your legal team:

| Consideration | What to Discuss |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Ownership** | Copyright status of AI-generated code remains legally unsettled in most jurisdictions |
| **License contamination** | Training data may include open-source code with copyleft licenses (GPL, AGPL) that could affect your codebase |
| **Vendor indemnification** | Some enterprise plans offer legal protection (e.g., Microsoft Copilot Enterprise includes IP indemnification) |
| **Sector compliance** | Regulated industries (healthcare, finance, government) may have additional IP requirements |

This guide focuses on Claude Code usage—not legal strategy. For IP guidance, consult specialized legal resources or your organization's legal counsel.

---

## 9. Claude's Governance & Values

### Constitutional AI Framework

Anthropic published Claude's constitution in January 2026 (CC0 license - public domain). This document defines the value hierarchy that guides Claude's behavior:

**Priority Order** (used to resolve conflicts):

1. **Broadly safe** - Never compromise human supervision and control
2. **Broadly ethical** - Honesty, harm avoidance, good conduct
3. **Anthropic compliance** - Internal guidelines and policies
4. **Genuinely helpful** - Real utility for users and society

### What This Means for Claude Code Users

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Security-sensitive requests | Claude prioritizes safety over helpfulness (may be more conservative) |
| Borderline biology/chemistry | May decline or ask for context to assess safety implications |
| Ethical conflicts | Will follow hierarchy: safety > ethics > compliance > utility |

### Why This Matters

- **Training data source**: Constitution is used to generate synthetic training examples
- **Behavior specification**: Reference document explaining intended vs. accidental outputs
- **Audit & governance**: Provides legal/ethical foundation for compliance reviews
- **Your own agents**: CC0 license allows reuse/adaptation for custom models

### Resources

- Constitution full text: https://www.anthropic.com/constitution
