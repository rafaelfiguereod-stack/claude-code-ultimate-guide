## 2.1.x Series (January-March 2026)

### v2.1.81 (2026-03-22)

- **New**: `--bare` flag for scripted `-p` calls — skips hooks, LSP, plugin sync, and skill directory walks; requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `apiKeyHelper` via `--settings` (OAuth and keychain auth disabled); auto-memory fully disabled
- **New**: `--channels` permission relay — channel servers that declare the permission capability can now forward tool approval prompts to your phone
- **Changed**: Plan mode hides the "clear context" option by default (restore with `"showClearContextOnPlanAccept": true` in settings)
- **Improved**: MCP read/search tool calls collapse into a single "Queried {server}" line (expand with Ctrl+O)
- **Improved**: `!` bash mode discoverability — Claude now suggests it when you need to run an interactive command
- **Improved**: Plugin freshness — ref-tracked plugins re-clone on every load to pick up upstream changes
- **Improved**: Remote Control session titles refresh after your third message; `/rename` now syncs title for RC sessions
- **Improved**: MCP OAuth updated to support Client ID Metadata Document (CIMD / SEP-991) for servers without Dynamic Client Registration
- **Fixed**: Resuming a worktree session now switches back to that worktree automatically
- **Fixed**: Multiple concurrent sessions requiring repeated re-authentication when one session refreshes its OAuth token
- **Fixed**: Voice mode silently swallowing retry failures with misleading "check your network" message; voice audio not recovering when server silently drops WebSocket
- **Fixed**: `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_BETAS` not suppressing the structured-outputs beta header (caused 400 errors on Vertex/Bedrock proxies)
- **Fixed**: Race condition where background agent task output could hang indefinitely when task completed between polling intervals
- **Fixed**: `/btw` not including pasted text when used during an active response
- **Fixed**: Plugin hooks blocking prompt submission when plugin directory is deleted mid-session
- **Fixed**: Remote Control `/exit` not reliably archiving the session
- **Fixed**: Node.js 18 crash
- **Fixed**: Unnecessary permission prompts for Bash commands containing dashes in strings
- **Disabled**: Line-by-line response streaming on Windows (including WSL in Windows Terminal) due to rendering issues
- **VSCode**: Fixed Windows PATH inheritance for Bash tool when using Git Bash (regression in v2.1.78)

### v2.1.80 (2026-03-20)

- **New**: `rate_limits` field in statusline scripts for displaying Claude.ai rate limit usage (5-hour and 7-day windows with `used_percentage` and `resets_at`)
- **New**: `source: 'settings'` plugin marketplace source — declare plugin entries inline in `settings.json`
- **New**: CLI tool usage detection to plugin tips, in addition to file pattern matching
- **New**: `effort` frontmatter support for skills and slash commands to override the model effort level when invoked
- **New**: `--channels` (research preview) — allow MCP servers to push messages into your session
- **Fixed**: `--resume` dropping parallel tool results — sessions with parallel tool calls now restore all tool_use/tool_result pairs instead of showing `[Tool result missing]` placeholders
- **Fixed**: Voice mode WebSocket failures caused by Cloudflare bot detection on non-browser TLS fingerprints
- **Fixed**: 400 errors when using fine-grained tool streaming through API proxies, Bedrock, or Vertex
- **Fixed**: `/remote-control` appearing for gateway and third-party provider deployments where it cannot function

- **Performance**: ~80MB memory reduction on startup for large repositories (tested on 250k-file repos)
- **Improved**: Responsiveness of `@` file autocomplete in large git repos; `/effort` now shows what auto currently resolves to
- **Improved**: `/permissions` — Tab and arrow keys now switch tabs from within a list; background tasks panel left arrow closes list view

### v2.1.79 (2026-03-19)

- **New**: `--console` flag to `claude auth login` for Anthropic Console (API billing) authentication
- **New**: "Show turn duration" toggle added to the `/config` menu
- **Fixed**: `claude -p` hanging when spawned as a subprocess without explicit stdin (e.g. Python `subprocess.run`)

- **Fixed**: `/btw` returning the main agent's output instead of answering the side question when triggered during streaming
- **Fixed**: Voice mode not activating correctly on startup when `voiceEnabled: true` is set
- **Fixed**: Enterprise users unable to retry on rate limit (429) errors
- **Fixed**: `SessionEnd` hooks not firing when using interactive `/resume` to switch sessions

- **VSCode**: Added `/remote-control` to bridge session to claude.ai/code for browser/phone continuation
- **VSCode**: Session tabs now get AI-generated titles based on first message
- **VSCode**: Fixed thinking pill showing "Thinking" instead of "Thought for Ns" after response completes

### v2.1.78 (2026-03-18)

- **New**: `StopFailure` hook event that fires when the turn ends due to an API error (rate limit, auth failure, etc.)
- **New**: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` variable for plugin persistent state that survives plugin updates; `/plugin uninstall` now prompts before deleting plugin data
- **New**: `effort`, `maxTurns`, and `disallowedTools` frontmatter support for plugin-shipped agents

- **New**: Response text now streams line-by-line as it's generated
- **Fixed**: ⚠️ **Security** — Silent sandbox disable when `sandbox.enabled: true` is set but dependencies are missing — now shows a visible startup warning
- **Fixed**: ⚠️ **Security** — `deny: ["mcp__servername"]` permission rules were not removing MCP server tools before sending to the model, allowing it to see and attempt blocked tools
- **Fixed**: ⚠️ **Security** — `.git`, `.claude`, and other protected directories were writable without a prompt in `bypassPermissions` mode
- **Fixed**: Infinite loop when API errors triggered stop hooks that re-fed blocking errors to the model

- **New**: `/branch` command (replaces `/fork`; `/fork` still works as an alias)
- **New**: `SendMessage` now auto-resumes stopped agents in the background instead of returning an error
- **Fixed**: ⚠️ **Security** — `PreToolUse` hooks returning `"allow"` could bypass `deny` permission rules including enterprise managed settings
- **Fixed**: Auto-updater accumulating tens of gigabytes of memory when slash-command overlay repeatedly opened/closed, triggering overlapping binary downloads
- **Fixed**: `--resume` silently truncating recent conversation history due to a race between memory-extraction writes and the main transcript
- **Fixed**: "Always Allow" on compound bash commands (e.g. `cd src && npm test`) saving a single rule for the full string instead of per-subcommand, leading to dead rules and repeated permission prompts
- **Fixed**: Write tool silently converting line endings when overwriting CRLF files or creating files in CRLF directories
- **Fixed**: Cost and token usage not tracked when API falls back to non-streaming mode
- **Fixed**: `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_BETAS` not stripping beta tool-schema fields, causing proxy gateways to reject requests

- **Breaking**: `Agent` tool no longer accepts a `resume` parameter — use `SendMessage({to: agentId})` to continue a previously spawned agent
- **VSCode**: Fixed gitignore patterns with commas silently excluding filetypes from `@`-mention file picker; improved scroll wheel responsiveness; improved plan preview tab titles
- **Performance**: Faster startup on macOS (~60ms) by reading keychain credentials in parallel with module loading; faster `--resume` on fork-heavy sessions (up to 45% faster, 100-150MB less peak memory)

- **Improved**: Model fallback notifications — now always visible with human-friendly model names
- **Improved**: Stale worktree cleanup — worktrees left behind after interrupted parallel runs are automatically cleaned up
- **Improved**: Blockquote readability on dark terminal themes — italic with left bar instead of dim
- **Updated**: `--plugin-dir` now accepts one path only; use repeated flags for multiple directories
- **VSCode**: Fixed gitignore patterns containing commas silently excluding entire filetypes from the `@`-mention file picker
